# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Introduction
This is my first JS project. I'm making this while working through the Odin Project JS lessons. 

I don't really know how to wrote proper README right now, but I'll do my best and describe the steps I've taken. 

My main goal is to get the flow of writing in programming language as well as develop problem solving skills.

## Starting out
1) Understand the problem
2) Plan
3) Pseudocode

## The Problem
Write a game where user can input 3 values - rock, paper or scissors. Then the computer will randomly choose one of the same values.
The game will compare each round and end at 5 rounds with total score.

## Plan
Make a game where player can choose from 3 options, reset and play it again as well as see the scoreboard and round counter.

## Technologies
Vanilla Javascript
HTML
CSS
