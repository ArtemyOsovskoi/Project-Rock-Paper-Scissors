# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Introduction
This is my first JS project. I'm making this while working through the Odin Project JS lessons. 

I don't really know how to wrote proper README right now, but I'll do my best and describe the steps I've taken. 

My main goal is to get the flow of writing in programming language as well as develop problem solving skills.

## Starting out
I followed the method described in the Odin Project.
1) Understand the problem
2) Plan
3) Pseudocode

## The Problem
I need to write a game where user can input 3 values - rock, paper or scissors. Then the computer will randomly choose one of the same values.
The game will compare each round and end at 5 rounds with total score.

## Plan
No UI for now.
Inputs: 3 strings - rock, paper, scissors.
Output: Result of each round with scores as well as total scores (winner\loser).

Pseudocode was written on paper, I also tried to explain my logic out loud in natural language.

## Technologies
Vanilla Javascript

## The Project status
WIP. I will add the UI later.
